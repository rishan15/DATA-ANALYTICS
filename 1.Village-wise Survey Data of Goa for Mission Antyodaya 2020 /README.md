## 📊 Key Insights & Findings  

### 🏡 **Infrastructure Analysis**  
- Average **639 households per village** have piped water.  
- Some villages have **zero water connections**, while others have **10,500+** connections.  

### 🌾 **Agriculture & Soil Testing**  
- Many villages have **low farmer participation** in **soil testing programs**.  
- Need for **awareness programs** to improve soil testing adoption.  

### 💰 **Labour Budget Allocation**  
- Unequal distribution of budget across villages.  
- Many villages **underutilized** their allocated funds.  

### 🤖 **Machine Learning Model**  
- Used **Random Forest Classifier** to predict villages with **high piped water coverage**.  
- Achieved **85.18% accuracy** in classification.
